# javascript
This repository will hold all the practice samples that I'll be trying during my course on javascript

# What's this all about ?

This repository will hold all my practice code on javascript starting from absolute basics to an intermediate javascript developer. 
This is me working on myself to learn things better with an absolute beginner mindset and this repository might help those who might be following a similar course of education/learning path or whatever you people wanna call it. 

Good luck and happy coding you all.!
